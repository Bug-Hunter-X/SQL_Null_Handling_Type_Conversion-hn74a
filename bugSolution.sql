To address NULL values, use explicit checks like `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, or functions such as `COALESCE` (or `IFNULL` in MySQL) to provide default values. For implicit type conversions, ensure you cast variables to their correct data types. Here's the improved SQL query:

```sql
-- Using COALESCE to handle NULL department_id
SELECT * FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id OR (e.department_id IS NULL AND d.id IS NULL);

-- Using COALESCE to handle NULL values and provide a default value
SELECT e.*, COALESCE(d.name, 'Unknown Department') AS department_name
FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Explicit type casting
SELECT * FROM products WHERE CAST(price AS UNSIGNED) = 10;
```
These examples explicitly handle NULLs and perform explicit type casting to improve query reliability and accuracy.
